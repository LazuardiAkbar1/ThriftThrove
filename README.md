## ThriftTrove : Unearth Your Secondhand Gems!

The market for buying and selling used goods is growing rapidly, especially in the fashion and goods sector, due to increasing awareness of the importance of reusing goods and efforts to reduce waste and environmental pollution. However, the lack of platforms specializing in buying and selling used goods has resulted in the dominance of offline shopping over online. Existing offline stores also tend to focus on fashion, not goods such as household furniture. In our project, we aim to create an e-commerce mobile application that can improve the accessibility and experience of online second-hand shopping. We believe that by providing an optimized and safe platform, we can expand the market for second-hand goods and contribute to environmental conservation efforts.

Our team, inspired by the growing fashion thrifting trend and awareness of the positive impact reuse has on the environment, discovered that there was a huge but untapped opportunity in the online second-hand goods market. From there, we decided to develop the ThriftTrove project, an e-commerce mobile application specifically designed to facilitate used shopping with a fun and safe experience. In this way, we hope to fill the gap in the market and encourage more people to choose sustainable options in shopping and we also hope that the ThriftTrove mobile application can help second-hand goods hunters make it easier for them to find the items they want.
